Tensorflow has grown to be one of the most popular and widely used framework for deep learning. It is used for resarch, exploration and product development at large scale in an effortless manner. This repository gives the users the first hand experience of creating deep neural models effortlessly without knowing the backend functionaly. 

## Repository Contents

This repository provides 2 variants of neural architectures

    - Sequential architectures
    - Parallel architectures
    
The users can provide the option they want. Following this the users will also be given the option to mention what type of backend code to use out of 3 prominent options.

    - Keras -> [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)
    - Estimator -> [tf.Estimator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/Estimator)
    - Full code implementation with tensors -> [tf.Variables, tf.function](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/low_level_intro)
